# smart-navigation-for-visually-impaired
Final Year Project – Smart Navigation System for Visually Impaired using technology: e.g., sensors + AI + path guidance
# Smart Navigation Aid for Visually Impaired Users

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a smart navigation assistance system for visually impaired individuals using deep learning-based object detection. The system detects obstacles such as people, vehicles, stairs, traffic signs, and barriers in real time.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Google Colab (GPU Training)

## Repository Structure
- src: Source code for training and detection
- dataset: Custom annotated dataset in YOLO format
- models: Trained model weights
- notebooks: Google Colab training notebook
- results: Detection outputs and screenshots
- docs: Reports and experiment logs

## FYP Phase-I Log Information
- Source Code: src folder
- Commit History: Available via GitHub commits
- Release Artifacts: models and results folders
- Labels: Dataset folders and documentation

## Execution
Model training was performed on Google Colab using GPU.
Testing and inference were conducted locally on a Windows system.
